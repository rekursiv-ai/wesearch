"""Reciprocal-rank fusion of results from two backends.

Merges Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex hit lists into one ranked list: each
backend contributes ``weight / (offset + rank)`` to a paper's score, summed
across backends, so cross-backend agreement outranks either backend's lone top
hit. Duplicates (same DOI or normalized title) are merged for fields and the
``sources`` tag.
