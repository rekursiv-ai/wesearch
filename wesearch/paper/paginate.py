"""Backend-agnostic cursor walker for paged list endpoints.

Every scholarly backend paginates differently on the wire -- Semantic Scholar
walks an integer ``offset``/``next`` cursor and signals its depth ceiling with a
400; OpenAlex walks a 1-based ``page`` bounded by ``meta.count`` -- but the
*contract* is identical: fetch pages of at most the endpoint's ceiling, keep the
rows a predicate accepts, stop at the caller's ``limit`` or at cursor
exhaustion, and report honestly whether the cursor was exhausted.

That contract lives here exactly once. A backend supplies a :class:`Cursor`
describing only its wire mechanics; it never writes a paging loop and never sets
a page size (this module is the sole writer of it, clamped to
:attr:`Cursor.page_size_max`). A new backend therefore cannot reintroduce the
page-size-overflow or lying-``complete`` bugs that independent per-backend loops
bred -- it has no loop to get wrong.

        offset, a 1-based page number, ...); the first call receives
