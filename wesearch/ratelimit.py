"""Rate limiters (sync-back test): sliding-window and token-bucket.

Each limiter blocks the caller until a request slot is available, via either
:meth:`acquire` (sync, sleeps the thread) or :meth:`acquire_async` (sleeps
the coroutine). Both paths share one pure reserve step that updates limiter
state under the store's lock and returns how long to wait; the wait then
happens *outside* the lock, so a slow caller never blocks the state update
for others. The two paths differ only in which sleep they call.

Scope of coordination depends on the limiter and its store. The default
backing coordinates callers within one process (threads and coroutines via
a ``threading.Lock``). :class:`TokenBucketRateLimiter` can instead take a
:class:`FileStore`, which holds its state in an ``fcntl``-locked file, so
several processes -- e.g. ones sharing an API key -- pace against one budget.

Choosing between them:
  - :class:`SlidingWindowRateLimiter` -- exact "no more than ``max_calls``
    in any ``per_seconds`` window". Tracks individual call timestamps;
    memory grows with ``max_calls``. In-process only (no cross-process
    store). Use when the provider enforces a true rolling window.
  - :class:`TokenBucketRateLimiter` -- smooth average rate with burst
    capacity ``max_calls``; O(1) state. The only limiter with a pluggable
    :class:`Store`, so the only one that shares a budget across processes.
    Use when you want steady pacing and an occasional burst is acceptable.

    the point -- a scraper on a perfectly fixed interval is itself a bot signal,

    at the same *mean* burned in testing at ~21 requests; the variance is

        - If caller A's ``now`` is *earlier* than the ``updated`` already on

          ``now - updated`` is negative, so A's ``tokens`` only shrink, A's

        - Reading ``now`` *inside* the lock would tighten spacing by at most
          the lock-hold time (microseconds here), not fix a correctness bug.

    Composes the two orthogonal signals a polite client needs: a
    :class:`RateLimiter` paces grants at a steady rate, and a
    :class:`CooldownGate` absorbs an external "slow down" (an HTTP 429, a
    CAPTCHA) so every requester waits rather than each rediscovering the block.
    :meth:`acquire`, called before each request, honors an active cooldown first
    and then spends one rate-limit token; :meth:`trigger_cooldown`, called when
    a block is observed, opens the shared window.

    Share one :class:`CooldownRateLimiter` across every request to a resource so
    a burst cannot outrun the limit; back both the limiter and the gate with a
    :class:`FileStore` to extend that budget across processes on the same host.

    Args:
      limiter: Paces grants; one :meth:`RateLimiter.acquire` per
        :meth:`acquire`.
      cooldown: Shared back-off window honored before each grant.
      cooldown_sec: Seconds :meth:`trigger_cooldown` holds the window open when
        a block is observed.
      max_cooldown_wait_sec: The longest active cooldown :meth:`acquire` will
        sleep through. When the remaining window EXCEEDS this, :meth:`acquire`
        raises :class:`CooldownActiveError` instead of sleeping -- so a long ban
        (e.g. a multi-hour scraping block) aborts the caller for rotation rather
        than hanging it. ``None`` (default) preserves the sleep-always behavior,

    :class:`FileStore` files under ``state_dir`` and a wall clock. Every process
    on the host that asks for the same ``key`` shares one budget -- the unit a
    per-IP / per-API-key limit is enforced against -- not merely coroutines in
    one process.

    Cached on the full argument tuple so repeated calls with the same ``key``
    return one instance; a different ``per_seconds`` or ``state_dir`` yields a
    distinct gate. Built lazily (never at import) so it has no filesystem side
    effect until first use. The wall clock is mandatory with :class:`FileStore`:
    the persisted timestamp is compared across processes, which share no
    monotonic epoch.
