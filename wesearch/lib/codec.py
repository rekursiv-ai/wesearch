"""Convert Python values to and from plain data, losslessly.

Plain data is ``str``, ``int``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``None``, and mappings and
sequences of them. :data:`PlainTree` is any such tree, read-only;
:data:`MutablePlainTree` is the dict-and-list form, which is also a
``PlainTree``.
This module never produces text or bytes; a caller hands plain data to
whichever writer it chooses.

What a dialect cannot carry natively is written as a ``py/*`` tag, using
jsonpickle's spelling where one exists:

- ``py/object``, ``py/type``, ``py/function``: a class instance, a class, or a
  function, by dotted import path.
- ``py/tuple``, ``py/set``, ``py/frozenset``, ``py/mappingproxy``: containers a
  dialect flattens to lists or dicts.
- ``py/float``, ``py/complex``, ``py/b64``, ``py/path``, ``py/uuid``,
  ``py/datetime``: values a dialect lacks.
- ``py/reduce``, ``py/hook``: a pickle reduce recipe and a caller-supplied codec.
- ``py/ref``: a back-reference by the path of the object's first occurrence, so a
  shared object or a cycle survives. ``py/id``, the older back-reference by
  encounter number, still reads.
- ``json://``: a dict key that is not a string, or that reads like a tag.

``to_plain`` takes a ``dialect`` naming the target format, which decides what
must be tagged; ``"json"`` tags non-finite floats, which ``"python"`` keeps
native. Both tag everything else alike.
``mutable`` picks dicts and lists, the default, or ``MappingProxyType`` and
tuples; either way the result is freshly built and shared with no one.
``from_plain`` takes no dialect: it accepts the tagged and native form of every
value alike, mutable or not.

``from_plain(data, T)`` lets a tag decide where one is present and ``T``
everywhere else, so a Protocol-typed field reads back as the class its tag
names. A value that fits neither raises :class:`ReadError`; there are no silent
defaults. ``allow_imports`` gates every tag that imports or calls code, except
a tag naming the very class ``T`` asks for: the caller already holds it.

Each tagged type has an encoder and a decoder, paired by name. A tag only
selects which decoder runs; the decoder is the same one untagged data reaches
through ``T``. Leaves pass through unencoded, and some targets (``Literal``,
unions, ``object``) only decode.

``immutable`` and ``mutable`` copy a plain tree to ``MappingProxyType`` and
tuples, or to dicts and lists, whichever form it starts in. Both always copy.

``parse(text, T)`` reads what a person typed, such as a command-line override.
It is lenient about syntax and strict about type: it accepts JSON, falls back
to the bare word, and lets ``T`` decide, so ``parse("123", str)`` is ``"123"``.
The result then passes through ``from_plain``, so text that does not fit ``T``
raises :class:`ReadError`, never a default.

Why not another serializer:

tl;dr: No library is perfect, including this one.

- C/Rust: the core is a compiled extension, not pure Python.
- text: encodes to human-readable text (JSON), not opaque bytes.
- class from data: decode builds a class the payload names by import path,
  beyond the declared type and its subclasses.
- callables: a function round-trips by import path, with no special field type.
- shared refs: an object referenced twice decodes as one object; cycles too.
- best-effort: bad input yields the partial value and every bad part's location.

In our case being pure python is a bad thing; native implementations are
faster and our preference would be to use msgspec. However we need pickle
semantics but as raw text.

Each mark is what a probe of msgspec 0.22, pydantic 2.13, cattrs 26.2,
mashumaro 3.23, and jsonpickle 4.1 returned:

- text: what one dataclass encodes to.
- class from data: an ``object`` field given a payload naming another class.
- callables: a field holding a module-level function.
- shared refs: one object in two fields; "split" decodes two separate copies.
- best-effort: two bad fields.

Fast libraries decode only classes known ahead of time: a class named in the
data means an import and code run on read. Codec gates that behind
``allow_imports``. One cycle shape fails to read: one through a dataclass
decoded as its declared type.
