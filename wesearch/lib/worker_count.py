Size a worker pool: parse a ``--workers`` argument, or compute the machine's default.

Run (``python -m wesearch.lib.worker_count``), it prints the machine's default
count and nothing else; the pre-commit hooks read their ``$WORKERS`` from it.

- :func:`worker_count` coerces a ``--workers`` argument without letting argparse
  exit 2. Every pre-commit gate shares it: ``affected.py`` sizes a thread pool
  over a SQLite index, ``houselint.py`` and ``unnecessary_assert_isinstance.py``
  a process pool over files, ``check_export_leaks.py`` a Copybara subprocess
  fan-out, and ``mutated.py`` a mutmut run.
- :func:`default_workers` is the count to use when none is given, and the one
  place it is computed: ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``'s ``&worker-entry`` anchor
  runs this module, and so does any tool that sizes a pool, so every job on a
  machine takes the same share of it. ``WORKERS_DEFAULT`` overrides it.

The formula::

  WORKERS = max(2, min(perf - 1, round(phys * 3/8)))
  WORKERS = max(1, min(WORKERS, available_RAM / 2 GiB))

``phys`` counts physical cores (SMT deduped), ``perf`` those at the top clock.
Deduped on ``(physical_package_id, core_id)``, not ``core_id`` alone: core ids
restart at 0 per socket, so a dual-socket host collapsed to one socket's worth
of cores and ran half the workers it should. Both terms were FITTED to measured
optima, not derived.

Do NOT "simplify" this to a core count: physical cores, top frequency domain,
and nproc/2 each overshot a box. The EPYC curve is a sawtooth (24, 32 fast; 20,
28 slow -- likely CCD alignment), so a nearby value is not interchangeable.

The memory term is a CEILING, not a ratio. "Available" is RAM free at launch,
not installed RAM, so it binds only when memory is already short: a host keeps
N workers unless under 2N GiB is free. It exists for a laptop whose browser and
sibling agents already hold most of RAM: there the formula's 7 workers (~1-1.8
GB each once torch loads) pushed into swap and froze the desktop. It reads
``vm_stat`` (macOS: free + file-backed + purgeable, i.e. Activity Monitor's
free plus "Cached Files") or ``MemAvailable`` (Linux): memory reclaimable
without paging out an application. Do NOT add macOS's inactive pages. On a
laptop near its limit they are mostly idle application memory, freed only by
compressing or swapping it -- the stall this ceiling exists to prevent.
File-backed already includes speculative read-ahead; purgeable is anonymous
memory an app marked disposable.

def worker_count(value: str) -> int:
    """Return ``value`` as a worker count, treating anything unusable as serial.

    NOT `type=int`. Every hook interpolates `--workers "$WORKERS"`, so a shell
    that never ran the `&worker-entry` wrapper passes `--workers ''` -- argparse
    exits 2, and the hook reads that nonzero exit as an empty selection and
    falls back to the sidecar probe. A silent downgrade to the scope the graph
    exists to beat is worse than running serial, which is what an unsized
    caller asked for. Every gate the module docstring lists shares this for
    the same reason: one `&worker-entry` anchor wraps them all, so each
    inherits that same empty-string case.

    Which makes EVERY escaping exception the same bug, so the conversion is
    guarded by `try`, not by a predicate. `str.isdigit()` was one, and it
    admits precisely what `int()` refuses: `"\N{SUPERSCRIPT TWO}".isdigit()` is
    True. `lstrip("-")` was the other, stripping every leading dash, so
    `--workers=--4` passed the digit test and raised at the conversion. Both
    reached argparse as exit 2 from inside the callable written to prevent it.

      value: The raw ``--workers`` argument, as argparse received it.
