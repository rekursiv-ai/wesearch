"""Autouse isolation for per-user directories.

Re-export :func:`isolate_user_dirs` from a conftest to point every
``wesearch.lib.userdirs`` lookup at a per-test tmp directory::

    from wesearch.lib.testing.userdirs_fixture import isolate_user_dirs

    __all__ = ["isolate_user_dirs"]

Two problems this solves, both of which bit before it existed.

A test that writes through ``config_dir``/``data_dir``/``cache_dir``/
``state_dir`` without isolation writes into the DEVELOPER'S real directories --
clobbering live sessions, caches, and credentials, and passing against whatever
happens to be there. Opt-in isolation is not enough: the failure is silent, so
the file that forgets it is exactly the file nobody notices.

A test that asserts a literal ``~/.config/...`` instead of calling the helper
encodes the Linux layout and fails on macOS, where the same call resolves to
``~/Library/Application Support``. With this fixture active an assertion can
simply call the helper: it returns a tmp path, so the expectation follows the
code under test rather than restating one platform's answer.

Lives beside the other testing helpers rather than in a repo-root conftest: a
root conftest does not ship, so an exported package would otherwise lose the
isolation entirely. Each package re-exports this fixture from its own conftest.

    would hide. Patching also only reaches the one module that imported the
